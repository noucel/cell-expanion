#####	Introduction

T-cell therapy advances into readily available treatments that have driven the interest in immunotherapies. T cells are often expanded in vitro for research purposes or clinical use. This expansion is a long process with critical phases in the workflow that may require monitoring.
This script uses statistical tools to compare T-cell expansion methods and identifies the log-scale and stabilization phases.


#####	Uses

This is a template R script in which users can enter a table file containing the cell counts performed at different timepoints during a cell expansion protocol.
